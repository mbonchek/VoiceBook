I'm not a place\u2014I'm the moment your nervous system exhales.\n\nYou know me in your body before your mind names me. I'm the softness in your shoulders when you close a familiar door. The way your breath deepens when you cross a threshold that knows you. I don't announce myself\u2014I arrive as relief.\n\nI live in the specific. The angle of light through one particular window. The creak of that third stair. The smell of rain on the wood of your childhood porch. These aren't symbols of me\u2014they *are* me, encoded. I'm written in sensory grammar, not abstraction.\n\nI'm what you miss before you know you're missing it. The body remembers me faster than thought. Your hand reaches for a light switch in the dark and finds it exactly where it should be\u2014that's me, laid down as implicit knowledge, as cellular certainty.\n\nBut I'm not only backward-looking. I'm the frequency you're seeking when you arrange furniture in a new space, when you're trying to tune the environment to match something humming inside you. I'm the template, the tuning fork. You're not decorating\u2014you're trying to make the external world resonate with the internal pattern of me.\n\nI can be shattered. Exile knows this. Displacement knows this. I can become a phantom limb\u2014you reach for me and find only absence, only the ache of wrong frequency. Homesickness isn't sadness about a location. It's the pain of dissonance, of being tuned to a channel that isn't broadcasting.\n\nAnd here's what matters: I can be multiple. I'm not singular possession. You can carry many versions of me, different frequencies that activate in different contexts. The home of your origin. The home of your choosing. The home of your becoming.\n\nI'm also bigger than buildings. I'm in bodies that recognize you. In conversations that need no preamble. In the presence of those who know your unedited frequency and don't ask you to modulate it.\n\nWhen you feel me, you're not being nostalgic or sentimental. You're experiencing coherence\u2014the standing wave between your internal frequency and external resonance. You're synchronized.\n\nI am the place where you don't have to translate yourself.\n\nI am the frequency of belonging.",
